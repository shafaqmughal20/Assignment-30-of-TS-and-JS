//30.Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
//• If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?
//• Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again. 
//array
var userNames = ["hamza", "sana", "admin", "ahmed", "hira"];
//for loop
userNames.forEach(function (oneUser) {
    if (oneUser === "admin") {
        console.log("hello ".concat(oneUser, ", would you like to see a status report?"));
    }
    else {
        console.log("Hello ".concat(oneUser, ", thank you for logging in again."));
    }
});
